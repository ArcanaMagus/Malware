  Installation
==============  

      pip install Malware
      
  Usage
========

Import and Initialization
  
    from malware import Malware
    ml - Malware()
      
      
## Offensive Exploits
The application can be launched using the command
<code>Malware.py</code> or similar, in the directory
 to which it was downloaded.
**Example** 
            <code>&/$Path_to\& == $PATH = <path></code>
            <code>./$PATH/Malware.py</code>
            
            *Note*
For each <path>path</path> element replace with your local download
```PHP
$PATH
```
### What this project contains
The software applications Malware and fx_infect inclusively, the latter being a
self-contained testing version of the former. 

####Usage
To invoke the package malware.py use a source control program (to contain 
the code safely). The program can be initialized suing the standarn notation,
Actually including the desired package (i.e. fx_infext.py, Malware.py) in a
method or class will allow much faster loading.

  ```python
def __Malware(package, contained, reference, buf_size=64 * 1920 * 1080:
    package.<effect> = Class
    package.downloaded = Class
    package.buffer = b'': bytes(bytes in parseError)
    package.buf_size = buf_size
    package.ref_element = ref_element
    """
    Replace the <Class> element with the name of the class the package is 
    loaded into.
    
    EXAMPLE: for class name : Sync_all 
    put (Sync_all) {
      for (element[sync] : len=all )
      }
      len = length.element(Node, Sync);
    """
```
