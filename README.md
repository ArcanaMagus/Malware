## Offensive Exploits
The application can be launched using the command
<code>Malware.py</code> or similar, in the directory
 to which it was downloaded.
**Example** 
            <code>&/$Path_to\& == $PATH = <path></code>
            <code>./$PATH/Malware.py</code>
            
            *Note*
For each <path>path</path> element replace with your local download
```PHP
$PATH
```
### What this project contains
The software applications Malware and fx_infect inclusively, the latter being a
self-contained testing version of the former. 

####Usage
To invoke the pacakge malware.py use a source control program (to contain 
the code safely). The program can be initialized suing the standarn notation,
Actually including the desired package (i.e. fx_infext.py, Malware.py) in a
method or class will allow much faster loading.
